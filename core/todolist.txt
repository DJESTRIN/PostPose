(3) Is there anything special needed for the TST and head fixed analysis? Or does distance and speed suffice?
    -Head fixed needs to have a way to look at metrics before and after trials ....

(4) How are we going to parse videos by day? 
    -Maybe I can write a function (which is hard coded) to rename files 
        Ex. 08_14 ==> BaselineDay1 ?
        Rename files to include day0, day7?, day14, day30
        Rename files to include groups: cort, control
        Ex. 24-09-12_day0_cort_C4629531_M1_front ....

(5) Is there a reason why we would need to pull all data for each subject into a single object file?
    - What is most reusable for the future?
    - Is this unnecessary? 

(6) Incorporate code that allows us to run stats and get final datasets. 
    - What should the final dataset look like?
        (A) A pickled object file that is parsable? Easiest to implement but harder for non-coders
        (B) A table. Really hard to implement because there are so many ways a table could be made. 
    - Should statistics be run in python? I am thinking yes. 

(7) What is the organization of the real data right now?
    - get more example data from Kenneth. 

(8) Add in an upper stop to the amount of time... 
(9) Put the tables into csv ...
