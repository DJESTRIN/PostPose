(1) Is there anything special needed for the TST and head fixed analysis? Or does distance and speed suffice?
    -Head fixed needs to have a way to look at metrics before and after trials ....

(2) Number of head entries???

(3) Are there different N for the summary data across conditions? 
    - Initially, we thought yes, but csv files indicate no because they are all same length.

(4) Unbiased analysis of openfield circle diameter? 
    What is a good way of defining the inner circle? We want a place where mice intentially enter the inner circle, not just spiratically move. 
    Plot day 0 times in inner circle with respect to diameter, find a threshold? I think this should be done for all day 0 mice regardless of group
    because they are stress naive 

    Take only control data and what inner circle size results no change across days.. 
    Find greatest change in slope and use that as threshold 

(5) Normalizing behavior. Is it best to normalize all behavior to day 0? Using a normalized change score per say?
    Normalization = (X - mouse day 0 average)/(mouse day 0 standard deviation)
    This would force day 0 data --> 0. 

(6) Calculate average distance from center (with respect to CORT and control). 
    Should we use this as a metric
