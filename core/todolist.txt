(1) Update all metric code to convert pixels to cms
    - Everything should be with respect to cms. This will also help us validate the metrics look correct. 
    - The diameter of the circle in centimeters is: 19.25 inches ==> 49 cms

(2) Distance, speed and acc mag still look weird. Why are they all very similar? 
    Should we do the binning and if so, what should that look like?
    Do together... 

(3) Is there anything special needed for the TST and head fixed analysis? Or does distance and speed suffice?
    -Head fixed needs to have a way to look at metrics before and after trials ....

(4) How are we going to parse videos by day? 
    -Maybe I can write a function (which is hard coded) to rename files 
        Ex. 08_14 ==> BaselineDay1 ?
        Rename files to include day0, day7?, day14, day30
        Rename files to include groups: cort, control
        Ex : 24-09-12_day0_cort_C4629531_M1_front ....

(5) Is there a reason why we would need to pull all data for each subject into a single object file?
    - What is most reusable for the future?
    - Is this unnecessary? 

(6) Incorporate code that allows us to run stats and get final datasets. 
    - What should the final dataset look like?
        (A) A pickled object file that is parsable? Easiest to implement but harder for non-coders
        (B) A table. Really hard to implement because there are so many ways a table could be made. 

    - Should statistics be run in python? I am thinking yes. 

(7) What is the organization of the real data right now?
