<h1> <b> üê≠ PostPose üê≠ </b> </h1> 
A repository for analyzing outputs of DeepLabCut, a pose-estimation software. This repository utalizes DLC's API for pose-estimation, and then anlayzes these outputs based on common experiments utilized in neuroscience. Originally, this pipeline was developed for SLURM-based clusters. However, the core code and scripts are meant to be run locally.

<h2> <b> Examples </b> </h2>
One can build an experimental arena in order to track specific regions of interest.

DLC-derived tracking data is then parsed in order to analyze various metrics in regions of interest.
